Florian,
 
As a former placement agent, I have compiled an extensive set of investor contact databases.
 
Breakdown of each separate database is below. 
 
-DATA GOES HERE-
 
There are roughly 77,000 total contacts across the lists, and I am offering these lists at $295 as a bundle. To make you comfortable with such a transaction, I am happy to send through the lists before any payment is required.
 
Please find extensive samples of the databases available in the attached excel spreadsheet, with each specific database in its own separate tab by title (family offices etc). The samples are exactly the same as the full sheets, just a truncated version (cut and paste). Let me know if anything is not clear, and happy to send through each individual sample in its own separate sheet. 
 
Please feel free to reply to this email if you wish to discuss in further detail, I'm also happy to discuss over a call.
 
Regards,"""
